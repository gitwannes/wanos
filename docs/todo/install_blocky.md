# ⚡ WanOS: Visual Automation Editor (IFTTT) Architecture Guide

This document is the source of truth for (1) the **entity_id prerequisite** (done in code) and (2) the **Blocky** visual automation editor (next).

**Entity_id cutover:** **done and verified** — registry birth/freeze, automations + structured config on `entity_id`, engine schema entity_id-only, Admin Debug registry check. **Pi Admin Debug: GREEN** (live metadata included; 0 errors, 0 warnings). Blocky may start.  
**`dashboard_map` removal:** **done** — display names live only in `device_metadata` / `device_name()`.

---

## ✅ Prerequisite (done) — One Device Map + Stable `entity_id`

Blocky and automations must not store raw hardware idxs in rules. Humans see friendly **names**; saved rules use stable **`entity_id`s**; hardware still uses **idx**.

### Identity model (three layers)

| Layer | Example | Who sees / uses it |
|---|---|---|
| Display `name` | `buro licht` | UI dropdowns only — may be renamed |
| `entity_id` | `switch.buro_licht` / `hue.light.buro_spot` | Stored in automation rules — frozen after birth |
| Physical `idx` | `71001` | Z-Wave / RFX / GPIO / `devices[]` / event bus |

### Single map (DRY)

* **One registry:** `device_metadata[idx]` holds `name`, `type`, `origin`, and `entity_id`.
* **`dashboard_map` removed** — display names are `meta.name` / `device_name()` only.
* **Do not** add a third in-memory dict on `SystemState` as a parallel source of truth.
* Reverse lookup (`entity_id → idx`) is **derived** at metadata rebuild time.
* Python device references: **always resolve** via the registry (no parallel magic idxs / no frozen string constants as source of truth).

### Birth, freeze, storage

* Users **never** type `entity_id`.
* On first registration (“birth”), the backend auto-assigns `entity_id` from the patterns below + slug of name.
* After birth, **renaming `name` does not change `entity_id`**.
* Hardware replace = change `idx`, **keep** `entity_id`.
* **Do not** re-derive `entity_id` from `name` on every boot.
* **Remap-all (regen ids from names):** **do not implement**.

### Persistence: `entity_registry.auto.yaml`

* System-owned file at WanOS root. Backend reads/writes it.
* **Not** in hand-edited `config.yaml`.
* Boot: load → merge into `device_metadata` → birth unknowns → write back.
* Orphans: **keep** row with **`status: removed`**.
* Documented in `docs/reference.md` and `docs/architecture.md`.

### `entity_id` patterns (locked)

| Kind | `entity_id` pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Hue light | `hue.light.<slug>` | `hue.light.buro_spot` |
| Hue group | `hue.group.<slug>` | `hue.group.living` |
| Z-Wave / RFX actuators (incl. “licht”) | `switch.<slug>` | `switch.buro_licht` |
| Vent / fan class | `switch.vent.<slug>` | `switch.vent.badk_1e` |
| SSR class | `switch.ssr.<slug>` | `switch.ssr.sauna` |
| Safety class | `switch.safety.<slug>` | `switch.safety.wisc` |
| Blinds | `blinds.<slug>` | `blinds.cinema` |
| Power | `sensor.power.<slug>` | `sensor.power.pc` |
| Temp/hum | `sensor.temp_hum.<slug>` | `sensor.temp_hum.sauna_high` |
| Energy | `sensor.energy.<slug>` | `sensor.energy.kwh_meter` |
| Fluid | `sensor.fluid.<slug>` | `sensor.fluid.cold` |
| Door | `sensor.door.<slug>` | `sensor.door.sauna` |
| Speaker | `media_player.<slug>` | `media_player.living` |
| Scene | `scene.<slug>` | |
| Unknown / tombstone | `unknown.<slug>` | |

**Confirm:** RFX = `switch.*`. Vents / SSR / safety use the dedicated `switch.vent|ssr|safety.*` prefixes (not plain `switch.<slug>`). Classification from name keywords / known idxs as implemented.

Z-Wave slug source: **`| name |` segment only**.

### Automations: `entity_id` only

* Full cutover; **zero dual support** for numeric device idxs in rules.
* Event-only triggers (`event: …`) unchanged.
* Unresolved `entity_id` at runtime: **log + skip — do not kill the engine**.
* Automatic domains live in **`automations.auto.yaml`** (`deviceexplorer_exclude`, `lighting`, `automations`).

### Migration & cutover tooling (complete)

| Tool | Role | Fate |
|---|---|---|
| **Script A** / **Cutover script** (`helpers/`) | One-off migrate + verify gate | **Deleted** |
| **Admin Debug check** | Permanent verify via `core/entity_registry_check.py` + **Admin → Debug** | **Keep** |

**Remap-all:** not implemented.

## ✅ Prerequisite gate — Pi Admin Debug GREEN

Confirmed from deployed Pi report (`ENTITY REGISTRY / CUTOVER CHECK`): **RESULT: GREEN**, no warnings. Live `device_metadata` included (`live_metadata_with_entity_id: 101`, `live_metadata_missing_entity_id: 0`). Local CLI check matches. **Prerequisite complete — start Blocky.**

---

## 📋 NEXT — Blocky implementation checklist

### Phase 0 — Blocky prep (decisions at start of Blocky work)

1. Define **automation device deny-list** (which `entity_id`s / prefixes must not appear in pickers: safety, SSR, system-only, hidden, etc.).
2. Automations / lighting / excludes already live in **`automations.auto.yaml`** — Blocky writes target that file (`ruamel` surgical write of `automations:`).
3. Inventory system events for the event dropdown dictionary.
4. **ON/OFF merge model** — locked below (schema + migration of existing sibling pairs).

### Phase 1 — Backend API (CRUD & hot-reload)

1. `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/automations`.
2. `ruamel.yaml` surgical write of `automations:` in **`automations.auto.yaml`** only (preserve comments).
3. Persist **`entity_id`** on device triggers/conditions/actions (never raw idx).
4. Support **first-class branched rules** (ON/OFF or event-pair branches) in schema + engine evaluate path.
5. Migrate existing sibling ON/OFF (and event ON/OFF) pairs that share the same trigger into one branched rule.
6. Dispatch `CONFIG_RELOAD_REQUESTED`; clear `AutomationEngine` config cache.

### Phase 2 — Frontend data model

1. Alpine editor store: `name`, `scene`, trigger (device or event), optional **ON branch** / **OFF branch** (each: `conditions[]`, `actions[]`), or **SYNC** when applicable.
2. Add-trigger / add-action binds **`entity_id`**; UI shows **`name`**.
3. One-sided rules allowed (ON-only or OFF-only); missing branch simply does not match that edge.

### Phase 3 — Semantic dropdowns

1. Device pickers from **`device_metadata`** (respect deny-list).
2. Event pickers from friendly event dictionary.
3. Users never type `entity_id`.

### Phase 4 — UI blocks (DaisyUI)

1. WHEN (device / system event) — one trigger; UI asks ON vs OFF (or shows both branches).
2. AND IF (time of day / device state) — **per branch** when conditions differ.
3. THEN DO (device / scene / event; force; rich light/speaker payloads for `hue.light.*` / `media_player.*` as applicable) — **per branch**.
4. Canonical template: **`switch.pc_monitors`** (ON: schemer + Sonos with volume/station; OFF: both off).

### Phase 5 — Hardening

1. Run Admin Debug entity/automation check after Blocky writes.
2. Confirm unresolved ids still log+skip without taking down the engine.
3. Document operator workflow (create rule → save → hot-reload → verify).

## 🚦 Decisions locked (prerequisite)

1. `entity_registry.auto.yaml`; freeze after birth; no remap-all.
2. Full cutover; zero dual support; Script A + Cutover script (delete after); Admin Debug check (keep).
3. Id patterns as table above (`hue.light` / `hue.group`; `switch` / `switch.vent|ssr|safety`; RFX = `switch`; sensors dotted).
4. Z-Wave slug from `| name |` only.
5. Orphans: `status: removed`.
6. Unresolved: log + skip; engine stays up.
7. Every device idx gets an `entity_id`; Python **always resolve** via registry (`core/well_known_entities.py` + `resolve_entity_id`). Magic-idx scan cleared (allowlist: `90001` vent lock).
8. ~~Remove `dashboard_map`~~ — **done**.
9. Blocky next; deny-list decided at Blocky start.
10. Auto domains extracted to **`automations.auto.yaml`**; Z-Wave map is **`config_zwave.auto.yaml`**.
11. **Pi Admin Debug GREEN** — entity_id prerequisite closed.

## 🚦 Decisions locked (Blocky — ON/OFF merge)

1. **Persistence = first-class branched rule** (proposal B): one YAML rule with ON/OFF (or event-pair) branches — not two sibling flat rules kept forever. Engine understands branches (or expands at load); Blocky CRUD reads/writes the branched shape.
2. **Pair key = same trigger `entity_id`** (device) or same event family for event pairs. Auto-group / migrate by that key.
3. **Canonical example:** `switch.pc_monitors` — ON branch (schemer + Sonos rich) / OFF branch (both off).
4. **`SYNC` only when ON and OFF are the same** (pure mirror: same targets, flipped state, no asymmetric rich payload or conditions). Otherwise use explicit ON/OFF branches.
5. **Event pairs merge too** (e.g. cinema / twilight / sauna ON↔OFF) under the same branched model.
6. **One-sided OK:** ON-only (or OFF-only) rules allowed; the absent edge simply does not match (e.g. `BuroCinemaPC_cosy`).

## 🚦 Open for Blocky start (not blocking prerequisite)

1. Exact deny-list contents.
2. Exact YAML key names for branches (`on:` / `off:` vs `branches:`) — decide at implement time; behavior above is locked.
